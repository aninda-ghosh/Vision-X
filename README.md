# Vision-X
 
The project was started to create a low budget solution for solving the problem faced by differently abled people. We developed the solution from scratch and optimized it to run on a platform like Raspberry Pi. 


### Prior System Requirements
* OpenCV built from source 
* Espeak system library for audio generation
* Haar Cascaded face and eye model. 


#### File and Folder Structure
* Source.cpp (Main Function)
* allHeader.h (includes all the dependent files)
* imageFunction.h (includes custom written image segmentation and classification algorithms)
* sound.h (Contains the voice syllables for context speech generation)
* commonFunction.h (Contains some generalized functions to be used for mathematical operations)


Visit the docs folder to understand the code flow and the output produced.
